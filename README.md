This Rust-based reverse shell client establishes a connection to an attacker's server, allowing the execution of shell commands remotely. It uses the Tokio async runtime for efficient handling of asynchronous I/O operations and leverages the colored crate for user-friendly output.

# üåê RuShell

**Rust Dir-Scan** is a fast and efficient directory scanner built using Rust. It allows users to scan a given URL for potential directories or files, utilizing a wordlist for enumeration. The tool is designed with speed and security in mind, making it ideal for web penetration testing and security assessments.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Features

- **Asynchronous Execution:** Utilizes Rust's async capabilities for efficient command execution.
- **Command History:** Maintains a history of executed commands.
- **Colored Output:** Enhances user experience with color-coded messages for better visibility.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for connection and command execution failures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
